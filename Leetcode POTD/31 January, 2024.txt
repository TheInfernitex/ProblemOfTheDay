Code:
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temp) {
        Stack<Integer> st=new Stack<>();
        int ans[]=new int[temp.length];
        for(int i=temp.length-1;i>=0;i--){
            while(!st.isEmpty() && temp[st.peek()]<=temp[i])st.pop();
            if(st.isEmpty()) ans[i]=0;
            else ans[i]=st.peek()-i;
            st.add(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

Approach: 
On reading the question, it was clear that we had to find the nearest larger number to the right for each element.
It is a popular pattern for stack data structure. Refer the code above for more details.
