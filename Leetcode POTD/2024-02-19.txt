Leetcode POTD: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/submissions/

Code:
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return (n>0 && (n&(n-1))==0);
    }
}
explanation: if a number is a power of 2, then it has a single set bit in binary representations. number-1 will have all the bits before the original set bit, set. Thus on logical AND with the number just lesser, a number which is power of 2 gives 0. Negative numbers are not power of two.
