Code: 
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> sequentialDigits(int low, int high) {
        List<Integer> ans=new ArrayList<>();
        String s="123456789";
        for(int size=1;size<=9;size++){
            for(int start=0;start<=9-size;start++){
                int a=Integer.parseInt(s.substring(start,start+size));
                if(a<=high && a>=low) ans.add(a);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

Approach: Since we need numbers in which  each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit,
they can only be the substring of the following string: "123456789". Then we just have to find all the substrings of this string which when converted into integer are in the range : [low,high] 
This could also be done using sliding window, but since the string's length is only 9, there's no need.
