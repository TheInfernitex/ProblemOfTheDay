Code:
class Solution
{
    //Function to check if a string is Pangram or not.
    public static boolean checkPangram  (String s) {
        // your code here
        boolean c[]=new boolean[26];
        s=s.toLowerCase();
        for(char ch: s.toCharArray()) {
            if(ch>='a' && ch<='z')c[(int)(ch-'a')]=true;
        }
        for(boolean i: c) if(!i)return i;
        return true;
    }
}

Approach: we have to check if each alphabet is present
First we make a boolean array of 26 length, where each element holds true if the character at its index is presSince the string can contain any character, I have converted the string to lowercase and then iterated over the string. If the character's ascii is between 'a' and 'z' (Java automatically converts characters into their ascii to compare).
If it meets the conditions, then we put them as true in a boolean array. 
Then in the end, we iterate over the array and check if any character had been left out.
