Code:
class Solution
{
   long DecimalValue(Node head)
   {
       long mod = (long) 1e9 + 7;
        long decimal_value = 0;
        
        while(head != null){
            decimal_value = (decimal_value * 2 + head.data) % mod;
            head= head.next;
        }
        return decimal_value;
   }
}

Approach:
The first approach which came to my mind was to iterate over the list to find its length and then iterate again adding bits according to their place value. Then I realised these are just bits. There is no need to find out the length in advance if we can easily make space for the next bit by simply left-shifting.
The %mod ensures that the answer does not get too large.
