Welcome to my coding practice repository! 

Here, I regularly post solutions to the "Problem of the Day" from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.
This repository serves as a record of my progress, a platform for explanation, and an opportunity to receive feedback on my coding style and problem-solving skills.

****Structure:****
Leetcode POTD: Contains solutions to the LeetCode "Problem of the Day" in form of text files. One for each date.
GFG POTD: Contains solutions to the GeeksforGeeks "Problem of the Day" in form of text files. One for each date.

I have explained my approach to the problem and the intuitions I had while solving it. The code is in **Java** Programming Language.
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to provide feedback, suggest improvements, or discuss alternative approaches.

While this repository primarily focuses on the "Problem of the Day," I welcome contributions and discussions. 
If you find a more efficient solution, have suggestions for improvements, or want to discuss the problem-solving approach, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
